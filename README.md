## Hi there, my name is Nikolas 👋

### 🙋‍♂️ About me

I'm from Bavaria, Germany 🇩🇪. I'm a dual student and when I'm not studying at OTH Amberg-Weiden during the semester 📚, I work at Witron 💻.
I have a huge passion for coding and love learning new programming languages 🖥️✨. Besides that, I enjoy going to the gym 🏋️, spending time with my amazing girlfriend ❤️, hanging out with friends 🎉, and playing video games 🎮. 
I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills! 🚀
